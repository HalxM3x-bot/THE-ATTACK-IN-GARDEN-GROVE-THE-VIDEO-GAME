Best video game in the world 
The Attack on Garden Grove is a story-driven action game about friendship, pressure, and control.

Set in Garden Grove, California, the game follows Kash, a 15-year-old JV football player from a wealthy family, and Peter, his best friend—a sharp, funny freshman basketball player from a lower-middle-class home. After Kash’s team wins the CIF Championship, something goes wrong. A hidden poisoning reacts with adrenaline, and Kash transforms into a giant monster in front of the entire city.

As Garden Grove goes into lockdown, players experience the story from both perspectives:
	•	Kash, struggling to control immense power without losing himself
	•	Peter, trying to protect his friend while uncovering the truth behind the transformation

The game blends free-roam exploration, story missions, and sports moments with unique systems like Kash’s Control Meter and Peter’s Stress Meter, where choices and discipline matter more than raw strength. Training with a mysterious athlete named Max, investigating a shadowy group called The Collective, and confronting betrayal from Kash’s girlfriend Celine all lead to multiple endings shaped by how you play.

After the story, players unlock free roam, sports modes, secrets, and character interactions that expand the world even further.

The Attack on Garden Grove isn’t just about becoming a monster—it’s about what it takes to stay human when everything is watching.

Tagline:
Power didn’t save him. Control did.
